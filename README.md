##  My Process

I started developing without Mobile First methodology and as soon as I finished my desktop layout I realized I had to refactor my CSS and follow Mobile First methodology because it would have made things easier as this is the first time I use grid.


## Built with

I developed this web application using semantic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I implemented BEM methodology as well as Mobile First.


## What I learned

Making layouts with CSS Grid and managing trackpad events.


##  Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank [Freddy Montes](https://twitter.com/fmontes) for sharing a thread with this challenge and [Estefany Aguilar](https://twitter.com/teffcode) because much of what I've learned in CSS is thanks to her courses in Platzi.
